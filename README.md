This project is an "Etch a Sketch" program that runs through a web browser. The Etch A Sketch starts off with a 4x4 grid of light gray squares that turn black when
the user hovers their mouse pointer over them. The user can click the "Clear Sketch" button to erase any filled in squares and specify how many squares they want in the
x- and y-axis of the Etch A Sketch.
